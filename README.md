Hi guys! I am rookie in the development game today, but will not be for long ;p!

I have done certain projects in webdev and am eager about learning ML.

My skill sets include JavaScript, React, Python, C++, HTML, CSS, and know a little of bootstrap :)
I also have experience on working with Content Management Framework Drupal!

Thanks that you read it! Hope we'll collab soon!
